# Case-Study---Random-Forest
# RR Diner Random Forest Case Study

This project is part of the Springboard Data Science Career Track and focuses on building classification models using decision trees and random forests. The goal is to analyze customer data from RR Diner and use machine learning to help the company make better business decisions.

## Project Overview

The case study involves:

- Exploring and cleaning the dataset
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical features
- Training and evaluating classification models using scikit-learn
- Comparing the performance of decision tree and random forest classifiers

## Methods and Tools

The following techniques and tools were used:

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier
- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for evaluation

## Results

After cleaning and preparing the data, I trained both a decision tree and a random forest classifier. The random forest model performed better overall, especially in terms of accuracy and generalization. Feature importance analysis helped identify which variables had the most influence on predictions.
